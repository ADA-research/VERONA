# VERification Of Neural Architectures (VERONA)

VERONA simplifies your experiment pipeline for performing local robustness verification on your networks and datasets. 
VERONA is class-based, which means that extending the existing configurations is accessible and easy. 
With one script it is possible to run an entire experiment with various networks, images and perturbation magnitudes (epsilons). 

Example use cases of the VERONA package include creating robustness distributions [Bosman, Berger, Hoos and van Rijn, 2025](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/18403), empirically measuring robustness of networks using adversarial attacks and verifying networks with formal verification tools using the external [auto-verify](https://github.com/ADA-research/auto-verify) package.

## Authors

This package was created and is maintained by members the [ADA Research Group](https://ada.liacs.nl/), which focuses on the development of AI techniques that complement human intelligence and automated algorithm design. The current core team includes:

- **Annelot Bosman** (LIACS, Leiden University)
- **Aaron Berger** (TU Delft)
- **Hendrik S. Baacke** (AIM, RWTH Aachen University)
- **Holger H. Hoos** (AIM, RWTH Aachen University)
- **Jan van Rijn** (LIACS, Leiden University)

## Installation and Environment Setup

We recommend to have a look at the [Documentation](https://ada-research.github.io/VERONA).

### Create Virtual Environment and install ada-verona

The python package for VERONA is called `ada-verona`, as our research group is called ADA.

To run ada-verona, we recommend to set up a conda environment. We also recommend using [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) as the package manager.

**Create a new conda environment named `verona_env`:**
```bash
conda create -n verona_env python=3.10
conda activate verona_env
```
### Installing the package

Inside the conda environment, install the ada-verona package preferably using uv (fast Python package installer and resolver). Alternatively, you can install the package using pip only.
```bash
uv pip install ada-verona
```

### Local installation for e.g. development purposes

If you want to install ada-verona locally using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ADA-research/VERONA.git
cd VERONA
uv pip install -e .
```

To help you get up and running with ada-verona, we provide a tutorial notebook and a collection of example scripts:
- **Main Guide:**
  - The primary resource for learning how to use VERONA is the Jupyter notebook found in the [`notebooks`](./notebooks/) folder. This tutorial notebook offers an overview of the package components, step-by-step instructions, and practical demonstrations of typical workflows. We highly recommend starting here to understand the core concepts and capabilities of the package.

- **Quick-Start Example Scripts:**
  - The [`scripts`](./scripts/) folder contains a variety of example scripts designed to help you get started quickly with ada-verona. These scripts cover common use cases and can be run directly (from within the `scripts` folder) to see how to perform tasks such as:
    - Running VERONA with a custom dataset and ab-crown ([`create_robustness_distribution_from_test_dataset.py`](./scripts/create_robustness_distribution_from_test_dataset.py)).
    - Loading a PyTorch dataset and running VERONA with one-to-any or one-to-one verification ([`create_robustness_dist_on_pytorch_dataset.py`](./scripts/create_robustness_dist_on_pytorch_dataset.py)).
    - Distributing jobs across multiple nodes using SLURM for large-scale experiments ([`multiple_jobs`](./scripts/multiple_jobs/) folder), including distributing tasks over CPU and GPU for different verifiers in the same experiment.
    - Using auto-verify integration ([`create_robustness_dist_with_auto_verify.py`](./scripts/create_robustness_dist_with_auto_verify.py)).

The notebook is your main entry point for learning and understanding the package, while the scripts serve as practical templates and quick-start resources for your own experiments.

## Datasets

The package was tested on the MNIST and the CIFAR10 dataset. Example scripts for executing the package on MNIST or a custom dataset can be found in the [`scripts`](./scripts/) folder.
