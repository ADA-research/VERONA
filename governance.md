# Governance

VERONA is moving from a **founder-led** model to a **self-appointing council** structure.  
This change reflects the growth of the project and our commitment to sustainably expand its functionality.

## Open Contribution
Anyone is welcome to open issues, submit pull requests, or propose new ideas.  
All contributions continue to be reviewed under our existing **four-eyes principle**, where a council member reviews and approves each PR.

## Council
A small council guides the project’s long-term direction.  
The council determines project scope, sets priorities, and approves major changes.

- **Self-appointing:** Any council member may propose new members. The council invites new members based on consensus.  
- **Term & Rotation:** Membership and rotation details will be documented.

## Decisions
Council decisions are made based on arguments and logic.  
If consensus cannot be reached after enough discussion, a majority vote is used.

## Current Members of the VERONA Council
- **Annelot Bosman** (@AWbosman) — founder  
- **Aaron Berger** (@Aaron99b) — founder  
- **Hendrik Baacke** (@henba1) — developer since May 2025  
- **Jan van Rijn** (@janvanrijn) — supervisory role
