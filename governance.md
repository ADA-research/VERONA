# Governance

VERONA is moving from a **founder-led** model to a **self-appointing council** structure.  
This change reflects the growth of the project and our commitment to sustainably expand its functionality.

## Open Contribution
Anyone is welcome to open issues, submit pull requests, or propose new ideas.  
All contributions continue to be reviewed under our existing **four-eyes principle**, where a council member reviews and approves each PR.
Most PRs are allowed to be reviewed by one council member, however, PRs that significantly deviate from the current scope and defined roadmap (#TODO: add link to roadmap md.) 
require a consensus of an appropriate subset of the council (>1) to be approved. 

## Council
A small council guides the project’s long-term direction.  
The council determines project scope, sets priorities, and approves major changes.

- **Self-appointing:** Any council member may propose new members. The council invites new members based on consensus.  
- **Term & Rotation:** Membership and rotation details will be documented.

## Roadmap
The council members govern based on the roadmap (add link to roadmap). 
They aim to have atleast one open meeting a year to discuss the roadmap with the community. 
Meetings will be announced in Discussions. 

## Decisions
Council decisions are made based on arguments and logic.  
If consensus cannot be reached after enough discussion, a majority vote is used.
